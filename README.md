# with-shadows-unity-scripts
Repo for the unity scripts of key interactions from my VR unity experience, "With Shadows"

## [DayCounter.cs](https://github.com/romyaboudarham/with-shadows-unity-scripts/blob/main/DayCounter.cs)
A date counter continuously increases. "Blinking" effect on the first few days ("Day X") to draw attention, then speeding up and switching to "Month X"
## [HandsCollisionStopAlarm.cs](https://github.com/romyaboudarham/with-shadows-unity-scripts/blob/main/HandsCollisionStopAlarm.cs)
Allows interaction when two game objects collide. When collided, change the activity status of certain game objects and triggered the timeline to start.
## [PhotoFadeOut.cs](https://github.com/romyaboudarham/with-shadows-unity-scripts/blob/main/PhotoFadeOut.cs)
Gradually decrease the opacity of a game object's material over time. Material must have a shader that supports transparency 
## [PostProcessingFadeIn.cs](https://github.com/romyaboudarham/with-shadows-unity-scripts/blob/main/PostProcessingFadeIn.cs)
Gradually increase the intensity of the post processing effect over time to introduce a dissociated, overwhelmed emotional state.
